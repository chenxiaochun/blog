**An open standard for sound, interoperable JavaScript promises—by implementers, for implementers.**

Promise 代表了一个异步操作的最终结果。与`promise`进行交互的一个主要方式就是通过它的`then`方法

This specification details the behavior of the then method, providing an interoperable base which all Promises/A+ conformant promise implementations can be depended on to provide. 
本规范详细描述了`then`方法的行为，

As such, the specification should be considered very stable. 
Although the Promises/A+ organization may occasionally revise this specification with minor backward-compatible changes to address newly-discovered corner cases, we will integrate large or backward-incompatible changes only after careful consideration, discussion, and testing.
